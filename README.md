# EZ Menu

A simple menu making application that stores User data and menu data in a MySQL database and publishes menus to public objects on Google Storage. Uses Firebase
Authentication, Google App Engine, Google Cloud SQL and Google Storage.

You'll need to have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) and the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/?hl=en)
installed and initialized to an App Engine project before running the code in
this sample.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:

        git clone https://github.com/dylanrdrake/ez-menu.git

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

        cd ez-menu/backend

1. Install the 3rd-party dependencies to the backend service:

        pip install -t lib/ -r requirements.txt

    if you get python3 print statement error, remove * in lib/, install pip2.7 and:

        pip2.7 install -t lib/ -r requirements.txt

1. To access Cloud SQL:

    - create file: backend/env_config.py to store sensitive logins, passwords and keys. The .gitignore will block these from being pushed to Github.


1. [Add Firebase to your app.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app)
1. Add your Firebase project ID to the backend’s `app.yaml` file as an
environment variable.
1. Select which providers you want to enable. Delete the providers from
`main.js` that you do no want to offer. Enable the providers you chose to keep
in the Firebase console under **Auth** > **Sign-in Method** >
**Sign-in providers**.
1. In the Firebase console, under **OAuth redirect domains**, click
**Add Domain** and enter the domain of your app on App Engine:
[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com. Do not include "http://" before the domain name.

## Run Locally
1. Install AppEngine included libaries listed in backend/app.yaml into your system python:

        pip install <package>

    These will automatically be imported into the runtime when deployed to AppEngine 

1. Add the backend host URL to `main.js`: http://localhost:8081.

1. Navigate to the root directory of the application and start the development
server with the following command:

        dev_appserver.py frontend/app.yaml backend/app.yaml

1. Visit [http://locahost:8080/](http://locahost:8080/) in a web browser.

## Deploy
1. Change the backend host URL in `main.js` to
https://backend-dot-[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com.
1. Deploy the application using the Cloud SDK command-line interface:

        gcloud app deploy frontend/app.yaml backend/app.yaml

    The Cloud Datastore indexes can take a while to update, so the application
    might not be fully functional immediately after deployment.

1. View the application live at https://[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com.


## TODO
  * Add color randomizer button next to logo. Add hex codes on hover.
  * Create sharing code.
  * QR Code generator.
  * Alert me when this menu changes:
    - Twilio docs in Google Cloud docs or Firebase messaging
    - link on published menu to app page where user can enter phone number
    - Take a look a cron jobs and how they could be utilized
  * What are people posting ticker
  * Move menu templates to Storage(NON public).
  * Kiosks: put code on back of pi. Set up local network site on pi that user can enter in wifi password. Have Set up Kiosk feature in web UI.
  * Load menus via Ajax direct from db instead of hosting on storage? Don't require auth when hitting /menus GET with menuid (Publish column has to be true).
